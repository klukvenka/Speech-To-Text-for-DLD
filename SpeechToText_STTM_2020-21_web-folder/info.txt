The purpose of this work is to develop a speech to text module that can understand children having Developmental language disorder, 
but also detect mistakes when speaking. Our work is based on the open source project DeepSpeech, wich provide many implementations
allowing the model to be used in many different forms (offline, online, mobile app, web app etc.)
We've managed using fine-tuning to get a working model using data directly gathered from sessions between teachers and children with
speech impairement but a lot of work is still remaining mainly in data gathering to get a solution that is functional 
and manages to help children.
